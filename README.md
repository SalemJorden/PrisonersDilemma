# PrisonersDilemma

This project is an interactive web-based implementation of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma game, pitting human players against various AI strategies. Built with React and D3.js, it features a sleek Material-UI interface, real-time score visualization, and multiple AI opponents including Tit-for-Tat, Always Cooperate, Always Defect, Random, Pavlov, and Grudger. 
This project is meant to be an educational tool for game theory and a fun, thought-provoking exploration of human-AI cooperation dynamics.
